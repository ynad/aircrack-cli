Tool for bruteforce using GPU(s)


Installation
------------
Download compressed archive from:
http://hashcat.net/oclhashcat/

Nothing to install or compile:
- for NVIDIA GPUs:
    Run "cudaHashcat32.bin" or "cudaHashcat64.bin" depending on your platform.
    On Windows, use same files with ".exe" extension.

- for AMD/ATI GPUs:
    Run "oclHashcat32.bin" o "oclHashcat32.bin" depending on your platform.
    On Windows, use same files with ".exe" extension.


Usage
-----
To use with packets captured by Aircrack-ng, first you need to convert your ".cap" file:
$ aircrack-ng foo.cap -J foo
the resulting file will have ".hccap" extension.

Now to start cracking a WPA/WPA2 handshake (specified with "-m 2500" option):
$ ./cudaHashcat64.bin -m 2500 foo.hccap dictionary.txt

There are tons of attack modes and supported algorithms (see ./cudaHashcat-plus64.bin --help).
